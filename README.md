# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

Initial Wire Frame (Desktop view - items should stack as columns when viewed at smaller screen width through use of flex containers):

![Wireframe](<Assets/Images/Wireframe - Portfolio Page.png>)

This web application consists of a single page portfolio, created to showcase my work and growing skill set to potential employers as a web developer looking to gain an entry-level position within the industry. As the bootcamp progresses, this page will be expanded upon and revised to better reflect my abilities and ongoing through processes as I deploy further web applications. At this early stage in my coding journey, I am attempting to highlight three particular core skills in CSS that have been studied thus far:

1. Use of flexbox to structure and format my single page portfolio in a way that allows for flexible layouts that respond and adapt to a user's screen size and/or device being used to view my portfolio.

2. Much like with Flexbox, using media queries so that I can apply different CSS stylings to my portfolio dependent upon specific conditions (specifically, screen width) to ensure that it reads as presentable and functional regardless of what device the user is viewing it on.

3. Use CSS variables to reduce repetition and redundant code by allowing me to quickly reuse values (background colours, border styling, etc.) throughout my CSS file and web portfolio. This has been achieved through use of the :root pseudo-class, as it has the maximum scope to be applied across my web page as an  equivalent to the HTML selector (and is of a higher specificity even as it is a pseudo-class rather than an element selector).
